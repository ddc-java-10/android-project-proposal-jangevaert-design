## Summary

This personalized safari app will guide guests of [Ajabu Adventures inc.](https://ajabu-adventures.com/) (Tanzania, East-Africa) through every step of their pre- and actual travel.
Guests will be prompted to download the app one week prior to their departure and will be assisted with their schedule through different features. 
At this stage the app will use a fixed itinerary so the client will fill out his/her own contact and flight information and no web forms will be used for input.
Since Ajabu Adventures is a small scale, high end company with four vehicles and four guides only, client data input will be mimimal and the itinerary will be limited to the most popular six-day trip with fixed overnight stays (i.e only six lodges will be used).


## Intended users

* **Travelers who need additional and easy accessible information.**
    > As a travel journalist, this app allows me to focus more on my wildlife photography instead of taking notes because the app gives me all the information on the lodges where I will stay at and the National Parks to visit.

* **First time Africa-travelers.**
    > The app offers me a packing list plus additional information on the country  and makes me feel comfortable knowing exactly what the activities and the place where we'll stay at will be at any given day. Furthermore we will be having all our contact information (at home as well of the tour company) stored in the app and ready with one click.
