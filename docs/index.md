## Summary

Replace this paragraph with one or more paragraphs summarizing the purpose and operation of the Android app you propose to develop in this project.
This personalized safari app will guide guests of [Ajabu Adventures inc.](https://ajabu-adventures.com/) (Tanzania, East-Africa) through every step of their pre-, actual and post-travel.
Guests will be prompted do download the app one week prior to their departure and will be assisted with different features depending on their calendar en location.

## Intended users

Write a bullet list here, including at least 2 different types of intended users. Make it reasonably specific; simply saying "Anyone who likes games" (for example) is not sufficiently specific.

For each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence (no more than 2 sentences), in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user needs to perform, and the benefit that will be obtained. The simplest user stories take the form 

> As a <type of intended user (_who_)> I want to <goal (_what_)> so that <benefit (_why_).

Please avoid writing too much for the user story. In particular, if the way the user story is written makes it difficult to see the _who_, _what_, and _why_, then you probably need to re-write it more directly. (On the other hand, a user story should not simply be a re-statement of the intended user description.)

Here is one (silly) example of an intended user, along with a user story. Please note not only the conceptual structure, but the Markdown syntax used.

* People who like to use randomness in their decision making.

    > As someone who enjoys randomness in my life, I need an app that lets me flip a virtual coin or roll one or more virtual dice, so that I can base my decisions on randomness, without having to carry coins or dice in my pockets.
* Travelers who need additional and easy accessible information.
    > As a travel journalist, this app allows me to focus more on my wildlife photography instead of taking notes because the app informs me of my exact location, the weather forecast, the lodges where I will stay at and the National Parks to visit./
* First time Africa-travelers.
    > This is my first time to travel to Africa and I am pretty nervous about it. The app reminds me of my flight information, offers me a packing list and makes me feel comfortable knowing exactly what the activities and the place where we'll stay be at any given day. Furthermore we will be introduced to our guide prior to departure and we have all our contact information (at home as well of the tour company stored in the app and ready with one click.  

## Functionality

List (using a bullet list&mdash;or ordered list, if order is relevant) the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app&mdash;i.e. tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary](#summary), but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. 

## Persistent data

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the client side. This should include any information that users of your system would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use. 
    
## Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
